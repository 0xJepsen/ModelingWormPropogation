# Modeling Worm Propogation in Large Networks
This is my study of the topology of different graphs to model the infection rate of worms in computer networks. I have utilized the Networkx python package to generate a variety of graphs and iterate through neighbors of graphs. I have also utilized pandas and matplotlib to plot and graph the results of my experiments. Some additional elementary utils packages are also included.
## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
- [Networkx](https://networkx.org/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

### Prerequisites
   1) Python 3

   2) Jupyter
   
### Setup
- Unzipp the project and navigate into the project directory

- Use pip to install dependancies
`pip install pandas
 pip install networkx
 pip install matplotlib`

- Run the comand `jupyter notebook` in the working directory. This will open a jupyter notebook in a browser window. Click on the file named "Modeling Worm Propagation in Large Networks" and follow along. Be sure to run the cells as you walk through the project as some cells depends on prior cells.
